This project uses [cargo make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) to combine the build commands for compiling the Rust `sunshine` module and linking it to the Flutter interface. This structure will eventually enable our substrate light client to talk directly to the Flutter interface (with no dependency on polkadot-js).

[`shekohex/flutterust`](https://github.com/shekohex/flutterust) is a generic template for Rust to Dart FFI

## Build Instructions

1. **[Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)**.

It is common for developers to get stuck setting the path to the Dart and Flutter SDKs after installation so take careful note of where these are installed. See the Dart docs: [Configure PATH and environment variables](https://dartcode.org/docs/configuring-path-and-environment-variables/) for more info.

2. Run `flutter doctor` to verify that you have everything needed to build and run a flutter application.

You probably won't have a connected device and that's OK, you can pick your emulator in step (5) below.

3. Install Cargo Make, Dart Bindgen, and CBindgen (skip if you already have them installed)

```
$ cargo install cargo-make cbindgen
$ cargo install dart-bindgen --features cli
```

4. Clone this repository.

### Android

_These instructions assume that you have installed Android Studio or the flutter plugins for Android Studio._

5. [Open the Android emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator).

6. Run the following commands in the root of the cloned repository.

```
$ cargo make android-dev # for android only using x86_64 emulator (run cargo make android to build for all android targets)
$ flutter run
```

### iOS

_These instructions assume that you may NOT have installed Android Studio nor the flutter plugins for Android Studio._

5. [Open the iOS emulator](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10379622/how-to-run-iphone-emulator-without-starting-xcode). This could be as simple as invoking the following command if you've set this alias before.

```
$ open -a simulator
```

You may have to specify File -> Open Device -> `$MODEL` once the simulator opens.

6. In the root of the cloned repo, run the following commands.

```
$ cargo make ios --profile release # Release Build is Required since debug build is very big.
$ flutter run
```

After you run the application, all changed state is saved in the directory. To restart from the `Generate Your Account` screen, you must reset the cloned repo to head (`git reset --hard HEAD`), delete the app from the simulator and do the last three commands listed above again.

### Start Local Test Node

1. Clone [Sunshine](https://github.com/sunshine-protocol/)
2. Start Development Node:

```
$ cargo run --bin sunshine-node -- --dev --discover-local --unsafe-rpc-external --unsafe-ws-external --rpc-external --ws-external --rpc-cors all
```

3. Start Application on Android Emulator (using `flutter run`).
